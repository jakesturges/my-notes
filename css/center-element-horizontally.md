# Centering an Element Horizontally w/in its Parent Container

By using the `margin: auto` and `width: 100%`elements can be center horzionally within its parent container

- `align-items: center` aligns items vertically

### Breakdown of Each Property

1. `width: 100%;` - sets the width of the elements to be equal to 100% of its parents container's width

   - element stretches to fit width of container

2. `margin: auto;` - calculates equal margins on all sides of the element

- This only works on block level elements
