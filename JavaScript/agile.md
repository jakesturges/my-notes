# Agile

- the Agile development approach welcomes changing requirments and cycles of iteration.
- the end user is involved early on

---

### Sprints

- short periods of work (usually 1 - 2 weeks) with well defined deliverables

### A / B Testing

- "split testing"
- a way for companies to show variations of thier app to subsets of their users and track whether those changes led to better business results

  ##### How it Works:

  - Measure the performance of each version against a KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
  - KPI - numbers that help teams track goals
    - EX: Improving bounce rate (how long a user stays on a site before leaving)
    - EX: Imporving up time; amount of time your website is running w / o any crashes
    - EX: Google tested over 40 shades of blue and green to land on their chosen hyperlink color
  - A / B testing is set up with a goal of improving a certain KPI
  - Start with a KPI, build a A / B test around it
